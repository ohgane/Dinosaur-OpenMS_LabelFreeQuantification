# Dinosaur-OpenMS_LabelFreeQuantification
[Proteomics] Utility scripts for analysis of label-free quantification data obtained on LTQ-Orbitrap with Dinosaur peak picker, SearchGUI/PeptideShaker, and OpenMS/TOPPAS.

# Step 1: Converting Thermo RAW files into MGF files (MS2) and mzML files (LC-MS1) with msConvert

# Step 2: Peptide/Protein identification by SearchGUI/PeptideShaker and export to mzIdentML format

# Step 3: Peak picking (feature detection) by Dinosaur

# Step 4: Add quantification to the identification list (combining the identification result and the peak picking result)

# (Optional) Step 5: Visualization of the results by R
